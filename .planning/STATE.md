## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: DOCX before PDF -- validates content pipeline with fewer moving parts (no Playwright dependency)
- [Roadmap]: English before French -- EN is simpler case; FR glossary pattern designed in but implemented Phase 3
- [Research]: python-docx run-level formatting (not style mutation) to avoid silent heading style failures
- [Phase 01]: Keyword matching uses first-match priority from YAML ordering; skill files deployed to both ~/.claude/skills/ (runtime) and repo skills/ (version control)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: python-docx heading style mutations fail silently -- must use run-level formatting from day one
- [Research]: French PBI terminology glossary (30-50 terms) needs domain research during Phase 3
